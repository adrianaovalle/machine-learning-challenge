# Machine Learning Challenge

## Description
Over a period of nine years in deep space, the NASA Kepler space telescope has been out on a planet-hunting mission to discover hidden planets outside of our solar system.
To help process this data, machine learning models were created capable of classifying candidate exoplanets from the raw dataset.
The classification consisted of:

* Preprocessing the raw data
* Tuning the models
* Comparing two or more models
